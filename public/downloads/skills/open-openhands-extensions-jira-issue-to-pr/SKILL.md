  or mentions automating GitHub PR creation from a Jira label.
  Deploys a cron-based OpenHands automation that watches a Jira Cloud project for issues
  labeled with a configurable label (default: "create-pr") and spawns an agent conversation
  to create a GitHub pull request for each new issue found. The target GitHub repository
  is read from the body of the Jira ticket - no repo parameter is required at deploy time.

# Jira → GitHub PR Automation

Deploys a cron automation that polls a Jira Cloud instance for open issues carrying a
configurable label and, for each new issue, starts an OpenHands agent conversation that
clones the GitHub repository specified in the ticket body, creates a branch, implements
or placeholders the requested change, and opens a pull request. Once the conversation
starts, it also posts a comment on the Jira ticket: "I'm on it: &lt;conversation URL&gt;".

## How It Works

1. **Poll** - every N minutes, `POST /rest/api/3/search/jql` on the Jira Cloud instance
   to find open issues with the configured label.
2. **Deduplicate** - on the very first run the script records a `first_run_at` baseline
   timestamp in the KV store; any issue whose `updated` timestamp predates that baseline
   is skipped (no backfill blast on first deploy). Using `updated` rather than `created`
   means an old issue that has its label added after the automation is deployed will still
   be picked up. Subsequent runs filter by both `first_run_at` and a KV-backed set of
   already-processed issue keys. A `max_new_per_run` cap (default 5) limits conversations
   started per cron firing as additional defense-in-depth.
3. **Dispatch** - for each new issue, start an independent agent conversation with a
   PR-creation prompt: `POST /api/conversations` on the agent server when running locally,
   or `POST /api/v1/app-conversations` on OpenHands Cloud. The prompt instructs the agent
   to extract the target GitHub repository (`owner/repo`) from the ticket body.
4. **Comment** - immediately after the conversation is created, post a Jira comment on the
   issue: `I'm on it: <conversation URL>`.
5. **Persist** - record the processed issue key so re-runs never duplicate work.

The polling run is lightweight (stdlib only, no SDK install); LLM costs are incurred only
when new issues are actually found.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying, ensure the following are in place:

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| **Jira API token** | Stored as an OpenHands secret (see [Jira API token setup](#jira-api-token)) |
| **GitHub access** | Local: a GitHub token stored as an OpenHands secret with `repo` + `workflow` scope so the spawned conversation can push branches and open PRs. OpenHands Cloud: the spawned conversation uses the user's connected GitHub integration (native integration recommended, or the GitHub MCP server) |
| **KV store** (OpenHands Cloud only) | The automation service must have its KV store enabled (`kvStore` in `GET /api/automation/v1/capabilities`); each cloud run starts in a fresh sandbox, so processed issues are remembered there |
| **Jira label** | The label to watch for (default: `create-pr`) must exist in the Jira project |
| **GitHub repo** | The target repository must exist and the GitHub token must have write access |

## Deploying the Automation

### Determine the API host and auth

Set `OPENHANDS_HOST` and `AUTH_HEADER` for the curl commands below:

- **OpenHands Cloud** - a `<HOST>` value is present in the system prompt:
  ```bash
  OPENHANDS_HOST="<HOST value>"
  AUTH_HEADER="Authorization: Bearer $OPENHANDS_API_KEY"
  ```
- **Local Agent Canvas** - no `<HOST>` value:
  ```bash
  OPENHANDS_HOST="http://localhost:8000"
  AUTH_HEADER="X-Session-API-Key: $OPENHANDS_AUTOMATION_API_KEY"
  ```

### Step 1 - Collect parameters

Gather the following from the user before proceeding:

| Parameter | Example | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `jira_base_url` | `https://acme.atlassian.net` | No trailing slash |
| `jira_email` | `alice@acme.com` | Atlassian account email for Basic auth |
| `jira_token_secret` | `JIRA_CLOUD_KEY` | Name of the OpenHands secret holding the API token |
| `jira_label` | `create-pr` | Label to watch for (optional, defaults to `create-pr`) |
| `max_new_per_run` | `5` | Max conversations dispatched per cron firing (optional, defaults to `5`) |
| `cron_schedule` | `*/5 * * * *` | Polling frequency in cron syntax |

> **Note**: The GitHub repository is not configured here. Each Jira ticket body must include
> a reference to the target GitHub repo in `owner/repo` format (e.g. `acme-org/backend`).
> The spawned agent extracts it from the ticket text.

### Step 2 - Create config.json

Create `config.json` next to `scripts/main.py` when packaging:

```json
{
  "jira_base_url":     "https://acme.atlassian.net",
  "jira_email":        "alice@acme.com",
  "jira_token_secret": "JIRA_CLOUD_KEY",
  "jira_label":        "create-pr",
  "max_new_per_run":   5
}
```

### Step 3 - Package the tarball

Copy `scripts/main.py` from this skill and package it with the `config.json`:

```bash
WORK=$(mktemp -d)
cp <skill-dir>/scripts/main.py "$WORK/main.py"
# write config.json into $WORK/config.json (see Step 2)
tar -czf /tmp/jira-issue-to-pr.tar.gz -C "$WORK" .
python3 -m py_compile "$WORK/main.py"   # validate syntax before uploading
```

### Step 4 - Upload the tarball

```bash
TARBALL_PATH=$(curl -s -X POST \
  "${OPENHANDS_HOST}/api/automation/v1/uploads?name=jira-issue-to-pr" \
  -H "$AUTH_HEADER" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/gzip" \
  --data-binary @/tmp/jira-issue-to-pr.tar.gz \
  | python3 -c "import sys,json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['tarball_path'])")
```

### Step 5 - Create the automation

```bash
curl -s -X POST "${OPENHANDS_HOST}/api/automation/v1" \
  -H "$AUTH_HEADER" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{
    \"name\": \"Jira issue-to-PR Poller\",
    \"trigger\": {
      \"type\":     \"cron\",
      \"schedule\": \"*/5 * * * *\",
      \"timezone\": \"UTC\"
    },
    \"tarball_path\": \"$TARBALL_PATH\",
    \"entrypoint\":   \"python3 main.py\",
    \"timeout\":      540
  }" | python3 -m json.tool
```

Save the returned `id` - use it for updates and monitoring.

### Step 6 - Verify with a test dispatch

```bash
curl -s -X POST \
  "${OPENHANDS_HOST}/api/automation/v1/<AUTOMATION_ID>/dispatch" \
  -H "$AUTH_HEADER" | python3 -m json.tool

# After ~30 seconds, check the run status:
curl -s "${OPENHANDS_HOST}/api/automation/v1/<AUTOMATION_ID>/runs?limit=1" \
  -H "$AUTH_HEADER" \
  | python3 -c "import sys,json; r=json.load(sys.stdin)['runs'][0]; print(r['status'], r.get('error_detail'))"
```

## Event-Based Alternative

Where Jira can reach the deployment over the internet (OpenHands Cloud and Enterprise),
Jira can push label events instead of being polled. That is a different automation from
the poller above: a prompt automation triggered by a Jira webhook, created with the
`openhands-automation` skill (see its "Custom Webhook Example: Jira Cloud").
`scripts/main.py` is not used, so its KV-backed deduplication and its "I'm on it"
comment do not apply; the prompt has to ask for whatever of that is wanted.

### Set up the webhook

The webhook is a pair: a custom webhook source in OpenHands and an admin webhook in
Jira, sharing a signing secret. `scripts/setup_webhook.py` creates both, so the user
does not have to open Jira or copy a URL and secret by hand. It needs the API token of
an account with the **Administer Jira** permission, stored as an OpenHands secret.

1. **Collect** the Jira site URL, the account email, the name of the secret holding that
   account's API token, and the label. A token used only for this step (for example
   `JIRA_ADMIN_TOKEN`) can be deleted from the user's secrets afterwards.
2. **Dry run, then ask.** Registering a webhook changes the user's Jira site, so show
   what will be created and wait for the user to confirm:

   ```bash
   OPENHANDS_API_KEY="$OPENHANDS_API_KEY" python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/setup_webhook.py apply --dry-run \
     --jira-base-url "https://acme.atlassian.net" --jira-email "alice@acme.com" \
     --jira-token-env JIRA_ADMIN_TOKEN --openhands-host "$OPENHANDS_HOST" --label create-pr
   ```

   The command has to name the secret (`--jira-token-env JIRA_ADMIN_TOKEN`): naming it is
   what makes its value available to the command.
3. **Apply** - the same command without `--dry-run`. It registers the OpenHands webhook
   (`source` `jira`, `webhookEvent`, `X-Hub-Signature`), creates the Jira webhook for
   *Issue created* and *Issue updated* limited to `labels = "create-pr"`, and sends one
   signed test request. `"signed_delivery_check": "ok"` in its output means the pair works.
   Running it again updates the Jira webhook in place and keeps the secret, so a
   failure half way cannot break a working pair. Add `--rotate-secret` when the two
   sides have drifted apart, for instance after the deployment was reinstalled.

   The secret is generated inside the script and is never printed. Do not ask the user
   for it, and do not try to read or echo it.
4. **If it exits with code 3**, the account is not a Jira administrator. Fall back to
   [Manual webhook setup](#manual-webhook-setup).

To stop Jira sending events, for example when the automation is deleted, run the same
command with `delete` in place of `apply`.

### Create the event-triggered automation

Create the automation with this trigger:

```json
{
  "type": "event",
  "source": "jira",
  "on": ["jira:issue_created", "jira:issue_updated"],
  "filter": "contains(issue.fields.labels, 'create-pr') && (webhookEvent == 'jira:issue_created' || length(changelog.items[?field == 'labels'] || `[]`) > `0`)"
}
```

Jira sends labels as plain strings, so the filter reads `issue.fields.labels`, not
`issue.fields.labels[].name`. The `changelog` check limits updates to those that
change the labels; without it every later edit of a labelled issue starts another run.
It still fires when another label is added to or removed from an issue that
carries the label, so have the prompt skip an issue that already has a pull request.

To verify, add the label to an issue and check the automation's runs.

### Manual webhook setup

Use this when the Jira account is not an administrator: the user, or their Jira
administrator, does both steps by hand.

1. **Register the webhook** with `"source": "jira"`, `"event_key_expr": "webhookEvent"`
   and `"signature_header": "X-Hub-Signature"` (see the `openhands-automation` skill for
   the request). The defaults (`type`, `X-Signature-256`) do not fit Jira: deliveries are
   refused with 401, or accepted and never matched.
2. **Configure Jira** - a Jira admin creates the webhook under Jira settings → System →
   WebHooks with the returned `webhook_url` and secret, the *Issue created* and
   *Issue updated* events, and a JQL filter such as `labels = create-pr`. A Jira
   Automation rule cannot be used instead: its "Send web request" action is not signed.

To test a manually configured webhook without Jira, sign a request the way Jira does:

```bash
BODY='{"webhookEvent":"jira:issue_created","issue":{"key":"TEST-1","fields":{"labels":["create-pr"]}}}'
SIG=$(printf '%s' "$BODY" | openssl dgst -sha256 -hmac "$WEBHOOK_SECRET" | awk '{print $NF}')
curl -s -X POST "<webhook_url>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Hub-Signature: sha256=$SIG" -d "$BODY"
```

`"matched": 1` in the response means the trigger fired and a run was started.

## Updating an Existing Deployment

To change configuration or update the script:

1. Edit `config.json` with new values.
2. Repackage and upload a new tarball (Steps 3-4 above).
3. PATCH the existing automation with the new `tarball_path`:

```bash
curl -s -X PATCH \
  "${OPENHANDS_HOST}/api/automation/v1/<AUTOMATION_ID>" \
  -H "$AUTH_HEADER" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"tarball_path\": \"<NEW_TARBALL_PATH>\"}"
```

## Resetting Processed State

To reprocess issues that were already handled (e.g., after testing), clear the KV store:

```bash
curl -s -X DELETE \
  "${OPENHANDS_HOST}/api/automation/v1/<KV_BASE>/v1/kv/state" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AUTOMATION_KV_TOKEN"
```

Or delete and recreate the automation to start with a clean state.

## Script Reference

The automation script lives at `scripts/main.py`. Key behaviors:

- **No SDK dependencies** - pure Python stdlib; no `setup.sh` or `uv` install needed.
- **Config file** - reads all parameters from `config.json` co-located with the script.
- **First-run baseline** - on the very first execution the script writes `first_run_at` (UTC timestamp) into the KV store and exits without dispatching; issues whose `updated` timestamp predates that baseline are skipped on all subsequent runs. Using `updated` (not `created`) means an old issue that has its label applied after deployment is correctly treated as new.
- **Per-run cap** - `max_new_per_run` (default 5) limits how many conversations are started per cron firing; any remaining new issues are dispatched on the next run.
- **KV store** - persists `{"processed_keys": [...], "first_run_at": "..."}` between runs; falls back to a local file in local dev environments where `AUTOMATION_KV_TOKEN` is absent (on OpenHands Cloud the run fails instead, since its sandbox does not persist).
- **Jira API** - uses `POST /rest/api/3/search/jql` (the current non-deprecated endpoint).
- **Conversation dispatch** - locally, calls `POST /api/conversations` on the agent server with the current user's LLM/agent settings forwarded to the new conversation; on OpenHands Cloud, calls `POST /api/v1/app-conversations`, which runs each conversation in its own sandbox with the user's settings, secrets and connected git provider.
- **Start confirmation** (OpenHands Cloud only) - the API answers a start request before the conversation exists, so the next run checks each one. A start that failed is made again, up to three times, and after that the failure is posted on the Jira issue.
- **Error transparency** - captures Jira HTTP response bodies in error messages for fast diagnosis.

`scripts/setup_webhook.py` belongs to the [event-based alternative](#event-based-alternative) and is not part of the poller's tarball. It is stdlib-only, reads `OPENHANDS_API_KEY` and the Jira API token from the environment, and prints a JSON summary that never contains the signing secret.

## Known Limitations

### Pre-existing issues updated after deployment

The deduplication filter compares each issue's `fields.updated` timestamp against
`first_run_at`. `updated` is Jira's last-modified timestamp for the issue as a whole —
it advances whenever **any** field changes (comments, priority, description, status, etc.),
not only when the `create-pr` label is applied.

This means a pre-existing issue that already carried the label at deployment time can
slip through the filter if it is later updated for an unrelated reason (e.g. someone adds
a comment), because its `updated` timestamp will have advanced past `first_run_at` while
its key is not yet in `processed_keys`.

**Workaround:** The only fully reliable way to detect exactly when a label was applied
is the Jira changelog API (`GET /rest/api/3/issue/{key}/changelog`), which requires an
extra HTTP call per issue. To avoid that overhead, keep the automation's scope narrow:
use a label that is exclusively added as a PR-creation signal and is not already present
on issues at the time of deployment.

Once an issue is successfully dispatched its key is written to `processed_keys` in the
KV store and is **permanently skipped on every future run** — regardless of subsequent
label changes, comments, or any other updates to the issue. The only way to re-trigger a
previously processed issue is to manually clear the KV store or delete and recreate the
automation. This means the risk window described above is finite: as soon as the
automation processes a pre-existing issue (even accidentally), it will never dispatch
that issue again.
