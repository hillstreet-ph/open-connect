# GitHub issue triage

Prioritize issues and define observable acceptance criteria using
[SKILL.md](SKILL.md). The scanner honors dependencies and sends changed issues
to conversations using the selected profile.

## Publication modes

Legacy agent publication is the default. The optional `triage_publication.py`
helper validates JSON recommendations and checks human inputs before every write.
It preserves text outside managed markers and edits/deletes only triage-marked
comments from the authenticated account. It skips identical writes and stops on
ambiguous markers. GitHub Actions readiness comments provide context, but neither
change the human-input fingerprint nor override policy.

This opt-in is **not credential isolation**: the agent can still write directly.
Enforced isolation needs a separate trusted publisher, read-only agent credentials,
and runtime support for passing results to the publisher.

## Operator setup

Bundle `worker.py`, `triage_publication.py`, `github_client.py`, and
`agent_conversation.py`. Entrypoint: `python3 worker.py`.

1. Place the publisher, `github_client.py`, and protected config in the delegated
   workspace. Set `triage_publisher_path` and `triage_publisher_config_path` to
   absolute file paths. Set both or neither; neither keeps legacy mode.
2. Set `triage_publisher_workspace: "shared-host"` only after checking manually
   that the agent can access those paths. The flag asserts access; it does not
   prove sandbox visibility. The scanner checks files and the repository allowlist before dispatch, then
   loads readiness policies from that same protected publisher config for its
   input fingerprints. Do not duplicate policies in the scanner config. Remote/container paths are unsupported. If the
   agent cannot invoke the helper, stop; do not fall back to direct writes.
3. Cloud conversations are unsupported: bundling does not provision their files,
   and the dispatcher cannot retrieve structured results from them.

Publisher config uses existing `repos` and optional `triage_readiness_policies`:

```json
{
  "repos": ["owner/repo"],
  "triage_readiness_policies": {
    "owner/repo": {
      "mode": "authorized-writers",
      "files": {".github/workflows/issue-readiness-check.yml": "<audited GitHub blob SHA>"}
    }
  }
}
```

Audit current policy and pin every relevant file to its actual 40-character
GitHub blob SHA (the file-content identifier). Only writer-only policies are
supported: the helper checks current SHAs and live `write`/`maintain`/`admin`
permission. Never select this mode for a policy that checks issue content.
Unknown, changed, or unsupported policies block new readiness grants, preserve
existing labels, and still allow criteria publication. No repository checker runs.

Precreate `ready-for-dev` and `priority:low/medium/high` labels. Use the same
GitHub account for scanner and publisher. Its fine-grained PAT needs selected-repo
Issues read/write, Contents read, and permission lookup access. Never put token
values in prompts or automation definitions.

## Races and retries

- Checks and writes are not atomic: people or other automations can change inputs
  between GET and PATCH. There is no shared lock or all-or-nothing update across
  issue bodies, comments, and labels. Changed inputs stop publication; the next
  scan recomputes the recommendation.
- The input fingerprint includes human readiness-label changes from the issue
  timeline, but excludes the publisher's and GitHub Actions' label changes.
- A completion receipt is saved only after publication finishes. Partial writes
  change the guarded-mode delivery key, allowing retries. If an unchanged failure
  is marked finished by the dispatcher, manually retry the same command.
- Configured policy changes affect the fingerprint. Upstream policy changes alone
  do not automatically retriage unchanged issues with managed markers.
